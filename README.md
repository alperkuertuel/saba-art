## Features For Artists
As an artist, you can manage your art pieces seamlessly. The design is kept very simple to let viewers focus on the shown art. The secure admin area, protected by a login system, allows you to crop your artwork before uploading it to the cloud. You can also update or delete your pieces as needed. The gallery is exclusively for viewers, featuring a user-friendly layout with individual detail pages for each artwork, making it easy to share on social media.
